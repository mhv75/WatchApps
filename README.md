Espruino App Loader (and Apps) for  P8, ROCK, Magic 3 Smart Watches
==============================

## Installation

### ROCK and Magic3
For a brand-new watch, you need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/fanoush/ds-d6/tree/master/espruino/DFU/Magic3) produced by @fanoush. Also following these instructions downgrade to SoftDevice S140-6.0.0.  After that you can flash the zip file from the firmware [directory](https://github.com/jeffmer/WatchApps/tree/main/firmware).  

IMPORTANT - you need to downgrade the SoftDevice before loading my Espruino zip file. The sequence is is this: install 1) Espruino using DaFlasher 2) DFU bootloader using WEBIDE  3)  Espruino zip file from fanoush repository 4) downgrade SoftDevice to 6.0.0 5) Espruino zip in this repository. Miss any of these steps results in a temporary (wait for battery flat) or permanent brick.

This build has a modified `lcd_spi_unbuf` module. The build makes the full 8 megabytes available to Espruino applications. 

### P8
For a brand-new P8, you need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/fanoush/ds-d6/tree/master/espruino/DFU/P8) produced by @fanoush to get the right bootloader required by Espruino - SDK12 with Softdevice S132 3.0. After that you can flash the zip file from the firmware [directory](https://github.com/jeffmer/WatchApps/tree/main/firmware).

This build has a modified `lcd_spi_unbuf` module that works with SPI FLASH. The build makes the full 4 megabytes available to Espruino applications. 

________________________________________________________

Once Espruino is installed use the [App Loader](https://mhv75.github.io/WatchApps/) to load `Bootloader`, `Main`, `Launcher` and `Settings` followed by the apps and widgets you want.

These provide a simple Bangle emulation environment which will let you load Bangle Apps from its App Loader.

Note: If you want to connect GadgetBridge from an Android phone load the **Android Integration** and **Messages** apps from the official **BangleApps** loader.
